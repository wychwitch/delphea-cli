# delphea-cli: a ranking tool 
Delphea is a tool I made to help my analysis paralysis that affects me due to my ADHD. Inspired by the pokemon favorites picker, with delphea you create *sheets* of *activities* that you then rank by choosing your favorites from a randomized list. I find it really helpful! 

I have plans to make a web app of this eventually, but for now it's a simple but powerful cli program. I personally recommend using it on a remote server you ssh to, rather than using it locally.
